## 1. How was your experience testing the given Webapp?
- I enjoyed this task because I learn better when I do stuff, not so much with just watching videos.
     

## 2. How did you write or manage your test case? Describe the process.
- I followed the template. With positive and negative test cases I investigated the real website so I would get all steps needed.
    

## 3. Do you recommend any other tools or styles for Test case management. 
 - I don't have experience with testing so I don't know what to recommed. This tool worked for me.

- I used only Visual Studio Code

     
## 5. Did you find any trouble? how did you solve the trouble?

## 6. Did you find any trouble using Github? have you used Github before? where?
- I have used Github in previous courses. I had to google how to share private repository, I had made only public ones before.
 


## 7. If in the future if you need to automate these test cases, which framework or language will you use? and describe why (Robot Framework, Cypress, Selenium, or any other )
- I've heard that Robot Framework is easy to use so I would go with that.

## 10. Write short Learning Reflection and  Free words Do you think that project helped in putting theoretical knowledge into practice? Describe? (is there anything else that you would like to share with us concerning the current study module). e.g. regarding the quality of content and your learning (or) improvement ideas? 
- When watching videos, my mind always starts to wander around and after some time I realize that I have not listened at all so this was pretty hard course for me.
- I would prefer practical assignments.
